LESSONS LEARNEED FROM BUILDING THE APP

* Make it easier to delete comments and replies: 
	Every comment and reply document should have the ObjectId of the article or post that it belongs to.
	Thus, when the post is deleted, just <Model>.deleteMany({post: postId}) to delete all the comments and replies in one momment. 

* Paginated scrolling doesn't seem to work well with images especially if they are large. 
The loading is long and thus, it affects the user experience. 

* You can't pass boolean values from client to server, only strings. 

* Be aware that when sending user data to the client, you need to exclude any sensitive information. 

* If you are using TinMCE editor in Vite, be sure to update the rollup options:
