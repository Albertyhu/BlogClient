How the search feature works: 

The user inputs a query onto the search bar.
When the search page is loaded, the app indentifies what type of information to retrieve,
whether that be posts, comments, categories, or users. 
The app is set to retrieve all posts published by default. 
The app sends a fetch request using the following endpoint:
	const FetchURL = `${apiURL}/${searchType}/get_search_data`;

	The endpoint is interchangeable for post, comments, categories, and users. 
	The variable "searchType" determines which information the user is trying to retrieve.

The server receives the request and collects all relevant information.
It collects all the strings into an array called collectedStrings and sends all the relevant information back to the client.
The client uses the object "collectedStrings" to compare its value to the user's query with the search function "HandleSearchQuery"
